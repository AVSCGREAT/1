                        <p>HackTX is an annual hackathon at the University of Texas at Austin. A hackathon is simply a space for students of any major to come together and come up with creative solutions using technology. They are a place to learn, to meet others, and to innovate. We design our hackathons to be beginner-friendly and will have plenty of mentors and workshops to guide you!</p>

                    <p class="question">I’m brand new to hackathons, where do I start?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Don’t worry if you feel lost, apply anyways! As we’ve said before, we will have plenty of resources, mentors, and workshops for you to learn from. You don’t have to have a working product by the end, you can come to learn something new :) We’ve also created The Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide for more information about hackathons and technologies to use!</p>
                    <p class="question">Virtual Hackathon? How does that work?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Our team has worked really hard to bring some of the best parts of our hackathons to you virtually. We have some exciting new ideas and the essential parts of our event will still be there. You’ll still be able to connect with other hackers, learn new skills, network with our sponsors, and have all the resources to create an amazing project!</p>
                    <p class="question">What do I need?</p>
                    <p class="answer">You will need a computer or some other technical device to work on and tune into our streams on. Try to download any necessary IDEs, packages, or any other large developer tools beforehand. To fully participate in our event, your internet connection needs to be able to handle a typical video call and live stream! We will also be using a group messaging system to communicate. Beyond that, just bring an eager attitude to make the most out of the hackathon!</p>
                    <p class="question">When is registration?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Early Bird Registration opens September 7th and closes on September 18th at 11:59 PM. If you are accepted, you will have a week to confirm your registration. If you are not accepted at this time, your application will be reviewed again when registration closes completely on October 9th, 11:59pm.</p>
                    <p class="question">When is HackTX 2020?</p>
                    <p class="answer">It'll be October 23-25, 2020! Hacking will be from 10 PM CT on Friday to 10 AM CT on Sunday. Exact schedule coming soon!</p>
                    <p class="question">Any rules?</p>
                    <p class="answer">All work must be done at the event. You can't demo something you didn't build. Don't talk about Fight Club. All attendees (hackers, supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc.) must abide by the MLH Code of Conduct.</p>
                    <p class="question">How do teams work?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Teams can be up to 5 members. Each member of the team will have to apply individually but teams will be admitted together. To create a team, complete your individual registration. Then, go to your personal dashboard and enter a unique name for your team. Finally, give that team name to your team members (capitalization matters!). They should input that team name in their registration portal. After that, you're done with registration and should be able to view everyone who is on your team.</p>
                    <p class="question">I don’t have a team, what should I do?</p>
                    <p class="answer">No worries! You don’t have to have a team, although we find that working with others and meeting new people is the best part of a hackathon and would recommend it!. Prior to the event, check out our Facebook group as there may be others looking for teammates there. We will also have team matching sessions where you can find people to work with at the hackathon!</p>
                    <p class="question">How do prizes work?</p>
                    <p class="answer">We are still working on the logistics for this but there will be some company-sponsored challenges as well as overall prizes for the hackathon. These prizes will be available for US attendees and we will work with you if you are international to figure something out. However, at this time, we cannot guarantee prizes for those that are international.</p>
                    <p class="question">How much money will this cost me?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Gratis. It's free. Freetail Hackers provides students with mentors, workshops, swag, resources, and prizes for all of our events!</p>
                    <p class="question">How do I volunteer at HackTX?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Volunteer applications will go live about a week after registration opens. We are primarily looking for technical mentors for this hackathon. Be sure to stay updated with our social media to get notified when volunteer applications open.</p>
                    <p class="question">What about hardware projects?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Unfortunately, we cannot provide hardware this year but if you have your own, you’re more than welcome to submit hardware projects!</p>
                    <p class="question">Swag???</p>
                    <p class="answer">Swag.<br/>We will have swag for our US attendees. However, at this time, we will not be able to ship internationally.</p>
